# An assignment master for csc1015F 

This assignment involves constructing Python functions that use recursion. You must NOT use 
loop constructs (such as ‘for’ and ‘while’) in your solutions. 
There are four questions. The first question involves identifying palindromes, the next two
involve constructing a module containing pattern matching functions. The last question is 
about identification of palindromic prime numbers.
